# tutor-work-php-basic
repo made for helping share solutions to some php tasks with PHP Flight

Warning - when running the post request you will most likely encounter a "Fatal error: Maximum execution time of 120 seconds exceeded (somewhere in xampp / apache)"
if you wish you can increase the exec time and get more of the dataset imported. This is a quick and straightforward implementation of the code to resolve all or most of its requirements it may not be the optimal solution so feel free to expand an re-factor on it, important thing is to keep learning.
